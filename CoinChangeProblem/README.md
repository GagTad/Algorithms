#  Coin Change Problem - Dynamic Programming

This project solves the **Coin Change Problem** using **Dynamic Programming**, applying both:

1. **Memoization** (Top-down with recursion)
2. **Tabulation** (Bottom-up with iteration)

##  Problem Statement

Given:
- A list of coin denominations `coins[]`
- A target amount `amount`
