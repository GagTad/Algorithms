# Fibonacci Sequence - Dynamic Programming Approaches

This project demonstrates two ways to compute the `n`-th Fibonacci number using **Dynamic Programming**:

1. **Memoization** (Top-down approach with recursion)
2. **Tabulation** (Bottom-up approach using iteration)

## Problem

Given a natural number `n`, compute the `n`-th number in the Fibonacci sequence.

The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:
- F(0) = 0
- F(1) = 1
- F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2) for n â‰¥ 2
